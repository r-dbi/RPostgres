Please briefly describe your problem and what output you expect. If you have a question, please don't use this form. Instead, ask on <https://stackoverflow.com/> or <https://community.rstudio.com/>.

Please include a minimal reproducible example (AKA a reprex). If you've never heard of a [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) before, start by reading <https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex>.

IMPORTANT: If your code requires accessing a specific database (with e.g. odbc, RSQLite, RJDBC), the issue you are experiencing is likely not a problem with the DBI package. Please file an issue with the appropriate DBI backend instead.
